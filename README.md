# SkipIntro Prepatcher

This prepatcher skips the game intro sequence between opening the game and reaching the main menu, so the main menu will appear immediately when ready.
This saves roughly 10 seconds per game load, so it is primarily useful if you restart the game a lot.

## Installation

This is a BepInEx prepatcher plugin for Silksong, so a working BepInEx installation for Silksong is required as a prerequisite. 
To install this prepatcher, unzip the latest release into the `BepInEx/patchers` directory.
